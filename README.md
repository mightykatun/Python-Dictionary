# Python-Dictionary
Finds the definition of a given word.

Thanks to github.com/sujithps for the base of the sourcedict.txt file.
(I just removed the empty lines and the "per letter indexing").

The dictdumper.py transorms the sourcedict.txt in a python dictionary and saves it in
the form of a string in dict.txt.

Then, dict.py loads that and finds the type (definition) based on a key user input (word).

Warning! Early release, current version does not work for multiple-words keys.

Do not distribute.
